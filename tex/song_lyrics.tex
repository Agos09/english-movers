\subsection*{I'm yours (by Jason)}
Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it\\
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted\\
I fell right through the cracks\\
Now I'm trying to get back\\
Before the cool done run out\\
I'll be giving it my bestest\\
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention\\
I reckon it's again my turn\\
To win some or learn some\\
But I won't hesitate no more, no more\\
It cannot wait, I'm yours\\
Hmm (hey, hey)\\
Well, open up your mind and see like me\\
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free\\
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love\\
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing\\
We're just one big family\\
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved\\
So I won't hesitate no more, no more\\
It cannot wait, I'm sure\\
There's no need to complicate\\
Our time is short\\
This is our fate, I'm yours\\
Do, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, but do you want to come on\\
Scooch on over closer, dear?\\
And I will nibble your ear\\
A-soo-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-bum\\
Whoa-oh-oh\\
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-whoa-whoa\\
Uh-huh, mmm-hmm\\
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror\\
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer\\
But my breath fogged up the glass\\
And so I drew a new face and I laughed\\
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason\\
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons\\
It's what we aim to do\\
Our name is our virtue\\
But I won't hesitate no more, no more\\
It cannot wait, I'm yours\\
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)\\
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (no more, no more)\\
And look into your heart, and you'll find (it cannot wait)\\
That the sky is yours (I'm sure)\\
So please don't, please don't, please don't (no need to complicate)\\
There's no need to complicate (our time is short)\\
'Cause our time is short (this is)\\
This, oh this, this is our fate (our fate)\\
I'm yours\\
Bra-bop-mm, da-bap-bop-mm-day\\
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do, mm-mm-mm-mm (hey, hey)\\
Oh, I'm yours\\
Oh, I'm yours\\
Oh, whoa, baby, do you believe I'm yours?\\
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours, mmm-hmm\\

\subsection*{Perfect (by Ed Sheeran)}
\thispagestyle{myheadings}
I found a love, for me\\
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead\\
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet\\
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me\\
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love\\
Not knowing what it was\\
I will not give you up this time\\
But darling, just kiss me slow\\
Your heart is all I own\\
And in your eyes, you're holding mine\\
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark\\
With you between my arms\\
Barefoot on the grass\\
Listening to our favourite song\\
When you said you looked a mess\\
I whispered underneath my breath\\
But you heard it\\
Darling, you look perfect tonight\\
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know\\
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home\\
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets\\
To carry love, to carry children of our own\\
We are still kids, but we're so in love\\
Fighting against all odds\\
I know we'll be alright this time\\
Darling, just hold my hand\\
Be my girl, I'll be your man\\
I see my future in your eyes\\
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark\\
With you between my arms\\
Barefoot on the grass\\
Listening to our favorite song\\
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful\\
I don't deserve this\\
Darling, you look perfect tonight\\
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark\\
With you between my arms\\
Barefoot on the grass\\
Listening to our favorite song\\
I have faith in what I see\\
Now I know I have met an angel in person\\
And she looks perfect\\
I don't deserve this\\
You look perfect tonight\\
